# The-Hangman-Game

Someone said: if you are doing what you want you will never work. 

It's true. 

When I'm programming I feel like I'm reading a favourite book or watching a very good movie. It's more than just a professional matter or hobby, it's a part of human beeing. It's change everything, how you thinking, feels surroundings. Additionaly it makes your brain more efficient for a long time! Oh... whait I've smelt a deadline here. Better I will send an email now. ;)
